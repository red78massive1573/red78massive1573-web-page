Redirector

In this page, im made my own redirector (although it's better to use [bit.ly](https://bit.ly))

I used 404.html so it can recieve every link (only recieve http / https link's (if you input without http / https it will loop redirect you to the same page))

Sorry if my grammar is bad

Use:

https://red78massive1573.github.io/red/(link)

Example:

[https://red78massive1573.github.io/red/https://google.com/](https://red78massive1573.github.io/red/https://google.com/)
